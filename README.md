|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `files`         | `Array<{ name: string, isDirectory: boolean, path: string }>`                                 | An array of file and folder objects representing the current directory structure. Each object includes `name`, `isDirectory`, and `path` properties. |
| `isLoading`     | `boolean`                                                                                      | A boolean indicating whether the application is currently performing an operation, such as creating, renaming, or deleting a file/folder. Displays a loading state if `true`. |
| `fileUploadConfig`| `{ url: string; headers?: { [key: string]: string } }` | Configuration object for file uploads. It includes the upload URL (`url`) and an optional `headers` object for setting custom HTTP headers in the upload request. The `headers` object can accept any standard or custom headers required by the server. Example: `{ url: "https://example.com/fileupload", headers: { Authorization: "Bearer" + TOKEN, "X-Custom-Header": "value" } }` |
| `onCreateFolder`| `(files: { name: string, isDirectory: boolean, path: string }[], folderName: string, folderPath: string) => void` | A callback function triggered when a new folder is created. Update the `files` state to include the new folder in the specified path. |
| `onRename`      | `(files: { name: string, isDirectory: boolean, path: string }[], selectedFile: { name: string, isDirectory: boolean, path: string }, newName: string) => void` | A callback function triggered when a file or folder is renamed. Update the `files` state to reflect the new name for the specified file or folder. |
| `onDelete`      | `(files: { name: string, isDirectory: boolean, path: string }[], file: { name: string, isDirectory: boolean, path: string }) => void` | A callback function triggered when a file or folder is deleted. Update the `files` state to remove the specified file or folder from the structure. |
| `onPaste`       | `(files: { name: string, isDirectory: boolean, path: string }[], pastePath: string, clipBoard: { isMoving: boolean, files: { name: string, isDirectory: boolean, path: string, children?: { name: string, isDirectory: boolean, path: string }[] }[] }) => void` | A callback function triggered when a file or folder is pasted (moved or copied). Update the files state to reflect the new location of the pasted items based on the clipBoard data. |
| `onRefresh`     | `() => void`                                                                                   | A callback function triggered when the file manager is refreshed. Use this to reload or refresh the `files` state to reflect any changes or updates. |
